### New features
* Added new `copy` command.
  ([#136](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/136){:target="_blank"})
    * **What it does**: The `copy` command allows users to copy the email ID of a contact at a certain index to their clipboard. The command format is `copy INDEX`, where `INDEX` is the position of the contact in the list.
    * **Impact**: This feature enhances the user experience by providing a quick and easy way to copy a contact's email ID, which can be particularly useful when the user needs to send an email to a contact.
    * **Possible improvements**: In the future, this feature could be extended to allow copying other contact details such as phone numbers or addresses.
