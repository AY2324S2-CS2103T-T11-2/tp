### Project: NUSContacts


NUSContacts is a desktop app designed for NUS Students, offering a streamlined way to manage their academic contacts with ease.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to escape `/` characters. (Pull request
  [#152](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/152))
  * What it does: Previously, strings like `` n/`` or `` a/`` are not allowed to be part of a name. After this feature is
    implemented, these can be included by escaping the `/` with a ``\ ``, the user should type `` n\/`` now.
  * Justification: This feature allows including `/` in names, because it may appear in unconventional names and it
    would inconvenience the user if the program does not allow it.

* **New Feature**: Highlight erroneous part of a command that causes an error.
  * What it does: When the user types a command that causes an error, the program will try to detect which part causes
  the error and highlight it in the command box to inform the user. (Pull request
  [#91](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/91))
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to navigate to the erroneous part quickly to fix it, which saves time.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=e0735389&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` and `v1.3`

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Correct the display of `Tags: [tag1]` in success messages, now if there's only one tag it will show singular `Tag: [tag1]`, if there's no tag that part will be omitted entirely (Pull request [#111](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/111))
  * Update the log messages printed on the console at program start/end to reflect the correct product name NUSContacts
    instead of AddressBook (Pull request [#98](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/98))
  * Warn the user when commands taking no argument like `list` get unexpected arguments (Pull request
    [#82](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/82))
  * Enable text wrapping in the result display text area (Pull request
    [#75](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/75))
  * Allow arbitrary characters to be entered in name (Pull request [#112](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/112))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the escape character feature.
    * Fixed several incorrect links.
    * Edited section headers to be consistent.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the highlight erroneous part feature:
      [#106](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/106)

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): I basically review almost every PRs. e.g.

    [#115](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/115),
    [#70](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/70), etc.
